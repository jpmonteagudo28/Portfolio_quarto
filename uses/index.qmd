Iâ€™ve gradually discovered a research workflow that suits my needs (and my budgetðŸ˜…) and maximizes productivity.

Iâ€™m leaving a list of the programs/software I regularly use as a way to track the changes to my workflow and also provide guidance to those looking for free resources to increase their efficiency and organization.

## Discovery and Idea Generation

### Writing

-   I no longer use [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/)â€“ an open-source note-taking app with a markdown editor and customizable plugins. Even after several updates, the plain text files didn't properly render to markdown. Another great option is [Obsidian](https://www.marclittlemore.com/beginners-guide-note-taking-obsidian/) which includes knowledge graphs to organize your thoughts.
-   I use [Typora](https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~rlenth/Power/index.html) to create stand-alone markdown files. Typora also supports [pandoc-flavored markdown](https://pandoc.org/index.html) which makes it easier to transform markdown to other formats like .docx, .pdf, etc.
-   I use a good olâ€™ [Mead Five Star Spiral Fat Lilâ€™ Pocket Notebook](https://www.fivestarbuiltstrong.com/p/multipacks/fat-lil-wirebound-notebook-college-ruled-6-pack-38027/) for note-taking (books I read, ideas, summaries, schedules, to-do lists). Iâ€™ve tried planners, calendars, apps and none of those things seem to keep me on track as brilliantly as a handwritten note in one of those fat little notebooks.
-   I use [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/search/) as my bibliography and citation manager. The free plan includes 2GB of storage, which is more than I need. I store my bibliographies in [Bibtex format](https://www.bibtex.org/).
-   I use [***Overleaf***](https://www.overleaf.com/) and [Detexify](https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) which makes finding LateX symbols a breeze. Just draw the symbol youâ€™re looking for and the site provides a list of possible matches with their LateX syntax.
-   I use [Natural Speech Reader](https://www.naturalreaders.com/) to help with text editing.

## Data Collection and Analysis

### Science and Research

-   I currently use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) for my data analysis and graphing needs, and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for everything else.
-   I used [G-Power](https://www.psychologie.hhu.de/arbeitsgruppen/allgemeine-psychologie-und-arbeitspsychologie/gpower) and [piface](https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~rlenth/Power/index.html) for sample size calculations, but piface's utility decreased as I began to use more complicated models.
-   My main statistical programming software was [SPSS](https://studentdiscounts.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAivGuBhBEEiwAWiFmYQw5XZfX_CVYuuY1zt8nJZsSbSLOtD9sRVQbcqyBNEUejnnA1-3OVBoCLVgQAvD_BwE) until 2020, but its lackluster versatility left me disappointed. I especially didnâ€™t like all the clicking and the way their syntax, output, and data panels were set up. Unfortunately, thatâ€™s the software of choice in many universities in the U.S., including mine.
-   I also use [Notepad ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), a text editor that supports more than two dozen programming languages (not markdown). I sometimes use it alongside VSCode.
-   I use [Github](https://github.com/) and [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to store almost everything I write and for version control.

## Publication

### Graphic Design

-   Iâ€™ve used [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) for every design in this website and personal documents. I also have free access to [Adobe InDesign](https://www.adobe.com/) but havenâ€™t used it much.
-   I totally recommend [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/), by Matthew Butterickâ€“ a typograhpy primer for the graphic designer and the layperson trying to create beautiful documents.
- I have been learning [Pollen](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/index.html), a markup language used to create beautiful digital books. PDFs, EPUBs, and HTML files are generated from a single source file.
-   I use PowerPoint and Google Slides to create simple and stunning presentations. I have free access to Microsoft products, and itâ€™s also the best slide editor Iâ€™ve seen.
-   I use [Google Fonts API](https://fonts.google.com/) for font selection and [David Jonathan Ross](https://djr.com/)â€™ typefaces. My preferred fonts are Montserrat, Cormorant, EB Garamond, Warbler, Fira Sans, Alegreya, and Libre Franklin.

### Productivity

-   I use [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) and [Google One](https://one.google.com/overview/) for file storage and backup. I get Dropbox for free through my school, and I pay for a family Google One subscription. However, both services cost about the same and offer similar storage space (3TB and 2TB respectively).
-   I use the Windows Clock app focus feature to track my time. Iâ€™m not easily distracted if Iâ€™m working towards a concrete, timed goal so scheduling times of intense mental activity is a huge help.
-   I use [Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/home) as my audio recording and automatic transcription service. I record presentations, interviews, talks, etc. and Otter.ai produces a solid transcript that I can then save or use in content creation.
-   I use [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [Claude](https://claude.ai/new), and [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) to answer all sorts of questions and to guide me in the creative process.

## Hardware

-   I use [Yubico](https://www.yubico.com/) and [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) for privacy and security.
-   I use a 2023 15.6â€³ 64GB RAM, 1TB Storage i7Core Dell Inspiron, and a 2020 13â€³ MacBook Pro

## Guides

-   [Good enough practices in scientific computing](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510) detail the process of organizing, structuring, and sharing data and research with collaborators while keeping track of all the changes.
-   [Four steps to an applied micro paper](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shapiro/files/foursteps.pdf), by Jesse Shapiro, outlines the process of writing an academic paper in the applied sciences. Itâ€™s a very succinct guide to help students and researchers improve their writing.
-   [How to give an applied micro talk](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shapiro/files/applied_micro_slides.pdf), also by Jesse Shapiro, is a brief explanation of why your presentations should be short and engaging, not so tediously structured and technical.
-   [Public speaking for academic economists](https://www.princeton.edu/~reddings/tradephd/public_speaking_for_academic_economists.pdf), by Rachel Meager, provides a simple and witty guide to public speaking for researchers and academics.
-   [The Plain Personâ€™s Guide to Plain Text Social Science](https://plain-text.co/). A useful primer on organizing and structuring your writing and research process in the Social Science sphere. It provides a template for research and writing that you can transform to suit your needs and budget (I mostly use free software except for Typora and Google One).
-   Kieran Healyâ€™s [*Making Slides*](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2018/03/24/making-slides/) guide to creating engaging slides by using layers, highlighting, and repetition to build your argument.
