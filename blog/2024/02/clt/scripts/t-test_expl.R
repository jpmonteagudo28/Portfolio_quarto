## Concrete example of tâ€“test on highly skewed data 
### ### Medical cost data for two groups with two age bands with > 3000 obs each
### ### Sub-gtoups of people with very different cost distributions (woman v. men, chronic v. acute v. no conditions)
### ### More than half the values are zero - indicating more than 5% of people had no medical care that year
##

##
## Simulated data
## 5/8 of data are zeros in any case
## the remaining data have log-normal distribution
## the parameters of that distribution are arranged to reproduce the observed means 
## and third quartile provided in the stack exchange example

## Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max.
