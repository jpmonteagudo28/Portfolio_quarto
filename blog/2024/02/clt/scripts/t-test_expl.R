## Concrete example of tâ€“test on highly skewed data 
### ### Medical cost data for two groups with two age bands with > 3000 obs each
### ### Sub-groups of people with very different cost distributions (woman v. men, chronic v. acute v. no conditions)
### ### More than half the values are zero - indicating more than 5% of people had no medical care that year
##
## Simulated data
## 5/8 of data are zeros in any case
## the remaining data have log-normal distribution
## the parameters of that distribution are arranged to reproduce the observed means 
## and third quantile provided in the stack exchange example
##
## Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max. 
## 0.0      0.0      0.0   4536.0    302.6 395300.0 
## Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max. 
## 0.0      0.0      0.0   4964.0    423.8 721700.0

## Generate positive random values with a median of 0, given Q3,
## and given mean. Make a proportion 1-e of them true zeros.
