This year will be a busy one for me:

-   I'm doing my [MPH in Epidemiology](https://www.liberty.edu/explore/mph-master-public-health-epidemiology/) and figuring out what research opportunities are available at my university.
-   After the COVID-19 pandemic, I've been working from home and spent a lot of time with my family.
-   I'm working full-time as a Learning and Development Specialist, doing some freelancing, and working on personal projects on the side whenever I get a chance.
-   I'm deepening my understanding of statistics and programming and that occupies a good chunk of my free time.
-   I have been obsessed with [kettlebells](https://www.roguefitness.com/conditioning/strength-equipment/kettlebells?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiArfauBhApEiwAeoB7qGKW1QZiYRoVee6Ak1xK2fM9izidlnV-h8GoWOpbN58oTeEv43dAFxoC_iYQAvD_BwE) for the past two and a half years. I've mastered a few movements but there's still a lot of ground to cover.
-   Eversince we moved to our new house, I've been working on some house repairs.
-   I've been reading science and religion books for the past three years until recently, when I decided to reread the classics and tell them to my girls who aren't old enough to read those yet.
