We get rid of tags and clutter, substitute those for simple keyboard strokes, and suddenly our text becomes much less chaotic. \n\n::::: {.multiple}\n\n::: {.columns .column-screen-inset}\n\n::: column\n\n```{.markdown}\n# Use `#` one hashtag for your first–level headings\nCreate Separate paragraphs using\n\nline breaks.\n## A second level heading using `##`?\n\n1.

HTML is also meant to be a text editor and not a programming language, while markdown combines text-based editing with programming languages^[Rmarkdown's knitr can execute code in Python, SQL, Bash, Stan, JS, CSS just to name a few languages].\n\n## Enter Pollen\n\nPollen is a publishing system built on top of Scribble and [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/)^[Racket is a programming language based on Lisp]. This markup language is typically used to create digital books, PDFs and other types of files as its output. \n\nDownloading and Installing Racket, Setting a new directory to Racket in MacOS, installing pollen, and creating your first pollen file.
