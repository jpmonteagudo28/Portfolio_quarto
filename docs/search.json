However, when I call the here function again, it sends me back to my root directory.\n\nhere::here()\n# [1] \"C:/Users/jpmonteagudo/Desktop/R/Project\"\n\nI would use the here function to get or write files and not just be there. If I don’t need anything from my subdirectory, then R will go back to its root, the .Rproj. For example, saving a .png file with multiple plots involves specifying the relative path using here::here().\n\n\n## Using ggplot2 to save my plots\n\nggsave(\"plots.png\",arranged_plots, \n       path = here::here(\"blog\",\"2024\",\"02\",\"post\",\"img\"),\n                width = 800,\n                height = 600,\n                units = \"px\",\n                dpi = 72)\n\n## The same can be done using base R\n\ndev.copy(png,here::here(\"blog\",\"2024\",\"02\",\"clt\",\"img\",\"plots.png\"), width = 800, height = 600)\ndev.off()\n\nThe set_here function\nIf I want to “just be somewhere” anytime I open my project, I would use another function– the set_here function. Basically, this function creates a .here file anywhere in your project so you can use this directory as your root. Here’s the description in the function’s syntax\n\nWhen here encounters such a file, it uses the directory that contains this file as root. This is useful if none of the default criteria apply. You need to restart the R session so that here() picks up the newly created file.\n\n\nhere::set_here(\"blog/2024\")\n# Created file .here in C:\\Users\\jpmonteagudo\\Desktop\\R\\Project\\blog\\2024. \n# Please start a new R session in the new project directory.\n\nNext, I start a new R session here, and RStudio will automatically set my directory to this folder. I don’t need to open the R project to reach this new directory. It will give me access to the folder’s files, and I can then set a relative path to other files.\n\n# Checking directory in new R session\nhere::here()\n# [1] \"C:/Users/jpmonteagudo/Desktop/R/Project/blog/2024\"\n\nFrom this new directory, I can reach files anywhere by using the here::here() function.\nThe confusing i_am function\nThis function has given me a headache. The here package is supposed to be a tool that facilitates collaboration and connectivity, but I just couldn’t get it to work until now.\nCall the here::i_am() function at the top of your script in the first chunk of your markdown file. It will accept a relative path and then establish the new project root there. So far, it only works when I point R to a specific file I’d like to work with. If I choose a file path that’s not in my project directory, it will just point to the original directory and throw an error. If the current directory is outside of the project where the current script is running, you’ll get an error message: Could not find associated project in working directory or any parent directory.\n\n# You're in the scripts folder working on ind.R but need to access summaryDat2.rds.\n#  Simply include the relative path to the data file at the top of your script:\nlibrary(readr)\ndata &lt;- read_csv(here::i_am(\"data/summaryDat2.rds\"))\n# From my script I'm now pointing to a folder containing my Dat2.R\n\nThe dr_here function\nThe here::dr_here() shows a default message explaining why the current directory was chosen. You probably won’t use this function often– unless you’re curious and want to understand how the package selects the root directory. However, if you used here::here(\"file_path\") and got an unexpected result, go ahead and call here::dr_here. It’ll most likely ask you to create a .here file or set your directory using the here::i_am() function.\nIn the end, the here package will make it easy to collaborate and work on your projects on any device by using the here::i_am(), here::here(), and here::set_here() functions."

    "text": "Music & Perfect Ratios\nThink of a guitar string vibrating at a base frequency of \\(329 Hz\\)—\\(329\\) cycles per second. By altering our position along the string, we change the frequency and thus produce different notes. If we moved from the nut (fret \\(0\\)) to between frets \\(11\\) and \\(12\\) and plucked the string, the frequency would now be twice as high—we call this an octave. If we moved \\(3/4\\) down from the nut, our new note would oscillate at three times the frequency of E4(\\(329Hz\\)). We can produce an infinite amount of notes by moving along the string and altering the speed of the oscillations. You are creating music with movement!\nTheory of Just Intonation\nHowever, keeping track of an infinite, unordered sequence of notes is impossible; instead, we use systems that allow us to measure and obtain the frequency of a small number of notes. One such system is called “just intonation” and a commonly seen tuning method is 5-limit tuning. This method allows us to find the exact, pure frequency of other notes by multiplying our base frequency by products of the power of prime numbers \\(2\\), \\(3\\), and \\(5\\) (e.g., \\(2^{-1} \\cdot 3^{1} \\cdot 5^{1}\\)).1\n1 In 5–limit tuning we only multiply integers to obtain other musical notes.2 octaves: \\(f_{x} = 2^{k}\\); perfect fifths: \\(3^{k}\\), major thirds: \\(5^{k},k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\).3 Sometimes the resulting note is outside our octave, and we simply divide it by two and bring it back to our interval.We call the sinusoidal movements in intervals of powers of \\(2\\) – octaves, powers of \\(3\\) represent perfect fifths, and powers of \\(5\\) are called major thirds2. By multiplying our base frequency by different combinations of these powers,3 we get sets of harmoniously consonant and discordant notes.\nThe Perfect ratios\nSo how can we make sure every note is consonant? Thankfully, the ancient Greeks discovered a way to create beautifully sounding and naturally occurring notes using perfect4 ratios for octaves, major fifths, and major thirds. These perfect ratios make music blend, flow, and feel “right”. These are the ratios that create all of the Lissajous figures we’ll explore today.\n4 perfect refers to ratios that produce “just” or “pure” melodic sounds.\nCoderatios &lt;- c(1,\"9/8\", \"5/4\",\"4/3\",\"3/2\", \"5/3\",\"15/8\",2,240,270,300,320,360,400,450,480)\ncols &lt;- c(\"C\",\"D\",\"E\",\"F\",\"G\",\"A\",\"B\",\"C'\")\nrows &lt;- c(\"Perfect Ratios\", \"Frequency(in Hz)\")\nperfect_ratios &lt;- matrix(ratios, ncol = 8, byrow = TRUE)\ncolnames(perfect_ratios) &lt;- cols\nrownames(perfect_ratios) &lt;- rows\nperfect_ratios\n##                  C     D     E     F     G     A     B      C'   \n## Perfect Ratios   \"1\"   \"9/8\" \"5/4\" \"4/3\" \"3/2\" \"5/3\" \"15/8\" \"2\"  \n## Frequency(in Hz) \"240\" \"270\" \"300\" \"320\" \"360\" \"400\" \"450\"  \"480\"\nknitr::kable(perfect_ratios)\n\n\nPerfect ratios in Just Intonation using 5-limit tuning method\n\n\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nA\nB\nC’\n\n\n\nPerfect Ratios\n1\n9/8\n5/4\n4/3\n3/2\n5/3\n15/8\n2\n\n\nFrequency(in Hz)\n240\n270\n300\n320\n360\n400\n450\n480"

The numerator of the perfect ratio will be the coefficient \\(a\\) of the \\(sin\\) function — \\(sin(t) = sin(at + \\delta)\\)— and the denominator \\(b\\) will go to the \\(y\\) coordinate — \\(sin(t) = sin(bt)\\). We’ll define our interval from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\pi\\)​​.\n5 the curves can also be created with \\(sin(t)\\) and \\(cos(t)\\) functions since \\(cos(t) = sin(t + \\frac{\\pi}{2})\\), but the phase difference will now be \\(\\frac{a}{b}*\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nHelpful Tip\n\n\n\nYou can familiarize yourself with Lissajous figures and their sine functions by using this interactive virtual oscilloscope.\n\n\nUsing the gganimate package in RStudio, we’ll build a data frame with a set number of times steps between \\(0\\) and \\(2\\pi\\)​; and the figures with coordinates for each perfect ratio. Then, we’ll stitch each plot with the time steps and coordinates to get a final \\(8 × 8\\) animated plot.\n\nCode## ------------------------------- ##\n## Creating Lissajous figures      ##\n## ------------------------------- ##\nlibrary(gganimate)# Loading libs   ##\nlibrary(tidyverse)                 ##\nlibrary(here)                      ##\nlibrary(av)                        ##\n## ------------------------------- ##\n\nparams &lt;- data.frame(\n  id &lt;- seq(1,500,1), # no. of steps\n  t &lt;- seq(0,2*pi, length.out = 500)  # equally spaced intervals 0-2*pi\n)\n\nfigs &lt;- function(t){\n  x1 &lt;- sin(t*1) # We're only using perfect ratios\n  y1 &lt;- sin(t*1)\n  \n  x2 &lt;- sin(t*9)\n  y2 &lt;- sin(t*8)\n  \n  x3 &lt;- sin(t*5)\n  y3 &lt;- sin(t*4)\n  \n  x4 &lt;- sin(t*4)\n  y4 &lt;- sin(t*3)\n  \n  x5 &lt;- sin(t*3)\n  y5 &lt;- sin(t*2)\n  \n  x6 &lt;- sin(t*5)\n  y6 &lt;- sin(t*3)\n  \n  x7 &lt;- sin(t*15)\n  y7 &lt;-  sin(t*8)\n  \n  x8 &lt;- sin(t*2)\n  y8 &lt;- sin(t*1)\n  \n  time &lt;- seq_along(t)\n  \n  data.frame( # Create df with x, y variables accross time\n    time, \n    x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8,\n    y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7, y8\n  )\n}\n\nactual_figs &lt;- figs(params$t)\n\ndf &lt;- bind_cols(params, actual_figs) |&gt; # bind two dfs\n  select(everything()) |&gt; # make data long\n  pivot_longer(x1:x8, names_to = \"x_group\", values_to = \"x\") |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(y1:y8, names_to = \"y_group\", values_to = \"y\") |&gt;\n  mutate(x_group = str_remove(x_group, \"x\"),\n         y_group = str_remove(y_group, \"y\")) |&gt;\n  unite(\"group_id\", x_group, y_group, remove = FALSE)\n\nplot &lt;- df|&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, color = group_id, group = group_id)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  geom_path() +\n  facet_grid(x_group ~ y_group) +\n  coord_equal() +\n  guides(color = \"none\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  transition_reveal(time) +\n  ease_aes(\"linear\")\n\nanimate(plot, duration = 30, fps = 24, height = 1080, width = 1080,\n        renderer = av_renderer())\n\nanim_save(filename = \"lissajous_figs.mp4\",\n          path = here::here(\"blog\",\"2024\",\"04\",\"lissajous\",\"documents\"),\n          height = 1080, width = 1080)\n#| Code adapted from Kieran Healy's blog \"Pi Day Circles\""
